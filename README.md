- [ox_core](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core)
- [esx](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core)
- [qbox](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core)

We do not guarantee compatibility or support for third-party resources.

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

- Intuitively structured data files make customization faster and easier.
- Micro-optimizations to reduce server load and improve sync reliability.
- Every detail matters: better item definitions, tooltip clarity, and metadata usage.
- Unified logic for items, stashes, shops, and interactions ‚Äî less duplication, more control.

### üß© Items

- Cleaner item configuration files with meaningful defaults and strong metadata support.
- Advanced weapon handling with durability, attachments, and ammo types.
- Built-in support for temporary or consumable items (e.g. boosters, access cards).
- Item action callbacks use declarative definitions, enabling quick scripting without bloated code.

### üè™ Shops

- Highly configurable shops using streamlined JSON or Lua files.
- Currency types, access restrictions, and item visibility ‚Äî all at your fingertips.
- Easily create dynamic or framework-linked vendors with minimal code.

### üì¶ Stashes

- Fully abstracted stash system, supporting per-player, per-job, or dynamic identifiers.
- Portable containers (bags, boxes, etc.) with nested inventories.
- Intelligent access control using groups, jobs, or licenses.
- Vehicle storage (glovebox/trunk) fully reimagined for flexibility and performance.

## üîç Why Reimagined?

We cleaned up OX_Inventory by removing outdated images and replacing them with more realistic ones. We also set custom progress bar texts and enhanced the overall experience to make it more immersive and in-depth.
